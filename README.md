ChemVision is an educational mobile application powered by Augmented Reality (AR) to help students visualize chemical elements in 3D.  
It bridges the gap between abstract chemical concepts and tangible learning by displaying stunning 3D models of real-world elements using marker-based AR technology.

ðŸŒŸ **Key Features:**
- Marker-based AR visualization of real-world chemical elements (e.g., Bismuth, Sulfur, Phosphorus)
- Interactive 3D models with rotation and zoom
- Audio narration and informative descriptions
- Chemistry quiz to reinforce conceptual understanding
- Android-ready build using Unity and Vuforia SDK

ðŸ”¬ Designed for high school students, science enthusiasts, and educators seeking an immersive way to teach or learn atomic structures and real elemental forms.

ðŸš€ Built with:
- Unity 2021/2022
- Vuforia Engine
- Blender / Sketchfab (3D assets)
- C# scripting

Made with love for science, design, and education ðŸ’¡
